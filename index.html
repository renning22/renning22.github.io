    <h1>Ning Ren</h1>
    
    <div class="bio">
        When I was 10, everything felt impossibly curious. I was fascinated by how computer games were made, but back then, the internet wasn't widespread. So I self-taught C programming by reading books, writing cool stuff with pure creativity and wonder.
        <br><br>
        After years in academia and the CS industry, I learned and grew tremendously. But somewhere along the way, I realized I'd never found that initial curiosity and excitement again. My knowledge and experience grew, yet they became constraints—枷锁—that somehow restricted my creativity and imagination.
        <br><br>
        LLM and AI agents represent an opportunity for many things in CS to be changed and done differently. Software will be created differently. This website is my attempt to do it all over again—to go back to my 10-year-old self with pure freedom of mind, and recreate that sense of wonder.
        <br><br>
        I'm ex-Googler, ex-ML-infra at Pony AI, now founding VibeTrading.dev. This is my technical blog showcasing ideas, cool demos, and research born from rediscovered curiosity.
