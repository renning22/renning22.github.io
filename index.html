    <h1>Ning Ren</h1>
    
    <div class="bio">
        When I was 10, everything felt impossibly curious. I was fascinated by how computer games were made, but the internet wasn't widespread yet. So I self-taught C programming by reading books, writing cool programs with pure creativity and boundless wonder.
        <br><br>
        Years later, after academia and the CS industry, I had learned and grown tremendously. But somewhere along the way, I realized I'd lost that initial spark of curiosity and excitement. My knowledge and experience had grown, yet they paradoxically became constraints that somehow restricted my creativity and imagination.
        <br><br>
        Today, LLM and AI agents represent a unique opportunityâ€”a chance for everything in CS to be reimagined and done differently. Software will be created in ways we've never seen before. This website is my attempt to start over, to return to my 10-year-old self with pure freedom of mind, and recreate that sense of wonder.
        <br><br>
        I'm ex-Googler, ex-ML-infra at Pony AI, now founding VibeTrading.dev. This is my technical blog showcasing ideas, demos, and research born from rediscovered curiosity.
